Documentation System
========================================

There are two main inspirations for the documentation system:

1. `Divio Documentation System <https://documentation.divio.com/>`_
2. `C4 Architectural Diagrams <https://c4model.com/>`_

The Divio documentation system advocates for 4 main categories of documentation:

1. Learning oriented tutorials
2. Problem-solving oriented guides
3. Information oriented references
4. Understanding oriented explanations

2 additional categories can be added for heavily technical projects:

5. Release notes
6. Landing pages

You can note that the main entry-point for the ``Python-Prefab`` repo is a landing page that
points examples of the 4 main categories advocated by the Divio system.

Additionally, the C4 model advocates for 4 levels of technical diagrams:

1. System context diagram
2. Container diagram
3. Component diagram
4. Code diagram

These diagrams can be implemented in any of the 4 main categories of documentation,
but will mainly appear in the explanations and design docs.
